## DataScienceWithStockData

My name is Dieu Linh and this is my first data science project.

This project focus on finding the relationships between stock data, mainly on Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange and Hanoi Stock Exchange during 2011 - 2020 period.

I use Python and the enviroments for coding are IDLE Python ver 3.9 for cleaning data and Jupyter Notebook for the model part.
By using K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering to find the stock pair having similiar pattern. I will check the result by the Pearson correlation coefficient.

The order of files is all_to_one; txt_to_csv; avg and finally is StockDataModeling.

The link I used to get the data: https://www.cophieu68.vn/export.php

Choose All Data (HOSE & HNX)

Note: Since this was my first project so all of my comment was written in my motherlanguage, I will updated it again in a English version.
